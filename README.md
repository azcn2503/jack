# :hocho:
Jack the Ripper

## Getting Started
Clone the repository, `cd` to it and then:
```bash
npm install
npm run build
node dist/example.js
```

For now, make changes in `src/example.js`, or write your own script then build and run it like above.

Add your targets (URLs) to your hit list, and say what you want Jack to do with them using async functions.

## Who's Jack?

He's a very thin wrapper around the selenium-webdriver package. Haven't you heard?
